/**
 * The `BaseBpmIT` class serves as an abstract base class for integration tests involving BPMN
 * processes, designed to streamline testing for process deployments, process execution, and
 * incident management. It provides utilities to validate deployment, start process instances, and
 * assert process states or incidents, ensuring consistency in test setups and assertions.
 *
 * <p>This class implements the `BpmIT` interface, which standardizes the method for providing start
 * process variables in BPMN integration tests. Additionally, it uses the
 * `@EnableBpmnTaskListenerPlugin` annotation to enable task listener plugins required for effective
 * BPMN testing.
 *
 * <p>The class relies on core Camunda services such as `RepositoryService` and `RuntimeService` to
 * interact with the process definitions and instances.
 *
 * <p>Key utilities include:
 *
 * <p>- **Deployment Validation**: Ensures that a process definition is successfully deployed. -
 * **Process Instance Management**: Provides methods for starting process instances with variables.
 * - **Assertions**: Validates process completion, waiting states, and incident occurrences. -
 * **Incident Querying**: Aggregates incident details for deeper test insights.
 *
 * <p>Usage Scenario: Subclass this base class and write test methods for specific BPMN processes.
 * Utilize utility methods like `startProcessInstance` and `assertProcessEnded` for cleaner, more
 * readable test cases.
 *
 * <p>Example:
 *
 * <p>```java @Test void myProcessTest() { ProcessDefinition definition =
 * validateDeployment("my-process-key"); ProcessInstance instance =
 * startProcessInstance("my-process-key"); assertProcessEnded(instance); } ```
 *
 * <p>Note: The class adopts the Template Method design pattern, where the base class defines the
 * common test utilities while delegating process-specific implementation to subclasses.

   * <p>This method is designed for use in integration tests to ensure that a running process

   * repeatedly check the status of the process instance, ensuring that it does not prematurely
   * assume the process has ended. - The polling interval is 500 milliseconds, and the maximum wait
   * time is set to 60 seconds. - If the process instance does not end within the specified timeout,

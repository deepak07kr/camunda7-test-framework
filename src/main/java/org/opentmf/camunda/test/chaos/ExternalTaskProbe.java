/**
 * Counts the external-task traffic that reaches the engine's REST door — including the requests an
 * active {@link EngineOutage} then refuses.
 *
 * <p>That inclusion is the point: the interesting claim during an outage is usually not "the
 * worker got nothing" but "the worker KEPT TRYING". A polling client that survives a dead engine
 * shows up here as a growing {@link #fetchAndLockAttempts()} while the outage is active, which is
 * the in-JVM proxy for what a queue-driven autoscaler would see in production.
 *
 * <p>{@link #queueDepth(String)} completes the picture from the engine side: how many external
 * tasks are waiting on a topic right now — the very number a scaler reacts to.
 *
 * <p>Counters are JVM-global (the filter cannot reach a test instance) and cleared by {@code
 * BaseBpmIT}'s {@code beforeEach} and by {@code EngineChaosExtension}.
